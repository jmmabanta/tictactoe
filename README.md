# Tic-Tac-Toe

My take on React's Tutorial!

## Main Changes

- Using Functional (arrow functions) Components with React Hooks
- The history is stored as a 2D list, rather than as a list of objects with one property

## Running Instructions

1. Make sure you have **Node v16.13.1 (LTS)** as the latest version does not work well with React from my testing.
2. Inside the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn` to download all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the server.
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the Tic-Tac-Toe website
